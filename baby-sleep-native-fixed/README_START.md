# ✅ Ready to Start!

## Dependencies Fixed

I've resolved the React version conflict by installing with `--legacy-peer-deps`.

## Start the App

```bash
cd baby-sleep-native-fixed
npm start
```

Then:
- Press `c` to clear cache
- Press `i` for iOS simulator
- Press `a` for Android emulator

## What Should Happen

1. Metro bundler should start successfully
2. You should see a QR code
3. The app should load in the simulator
4. You should see your login screen!

## If You See Errors

- Make sure your backend is running on `http://localhost:5001`
- Check the console for any module resolution errors
- The new project should work because it was properly initialized

This project should work correctly now! 🎉
