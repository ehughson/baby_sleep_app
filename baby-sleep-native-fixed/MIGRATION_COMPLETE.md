# ✅ Project Recreated Successfully!

## What I Did

1. ✅ Created new Expo project with `create-expo-app` (SDK 54)
2. ✅ Installed expo-router and all dependencies
3. ✅ Copied your `src/` directory (services, utils, constants)
4. ✅ Copied your `app/` directory (screens, navigation)
5. ✅ Updated package.json to use `expo-router/entry`
6. ✅ Copied babel.config.js

## Next Steps

1. **Navigate to the new project:**
   ```bash
   cd baby-sleep-native-fixed
   ```

2. **Start Expo:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   Press `c` to clear cache, then `i` for iOS simulator

## What's Different

- ✅ Properly initialized with create-expo-app
- ✅ Metro should now resolve modules correctly
- ✅ Using Expo SDK 54 (newer than 51)
- ✅ All your code has been migrated

## If You Want to Use This Instead

You can either:
1. **Use the new project** (`baby-sleep-native-fixed`) - recommended
2. **Or rename it** to replace the old one:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/emma/baby_sleep_app
   mv baby-sleep-native baby-sleep-native-old
   mv baby-sleep-native-fixed baby-sleep-native
   ```

The new project should work correctly because it was initialized properly with Expo's tooling!
